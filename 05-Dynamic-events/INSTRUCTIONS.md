# Task

When a user interacts with your React app, this will trigger events. You've learned how to handle user-generated events, so now you can reinforce what you've learned by practicing event handling. To make this more fun, in this exercise, you'll be building a simple number-guessing game.

## Instructions

### **Step 1**

The starting point for this task is the `App` component, which currently includes an `h1` element that reads: "Task: Add a button and handle a click event".

Add a `button` element with opening and closing button tags below the `h1` element.

### **Step 2**

In between the opening and closing button tags, add the following text: `Guess the number between 1 and 3`.

### **Step 3**

Inside the opening button tag, add the onClick event-handling attribute, and pass it the following JSX expression: `{handleClick}`.

### **Step 4**

Above the return statement of the App component - but still inside the App function - add the following ES5 function declaration: 
```js
function handleClick() {
    let randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 1
    console.log(randomNum)
    let userInput = prompt('type a number');
    alert(`Computer number: ${randomNum}, Your guess: ${userInput}`)
}
```

⚠️ Important:

1. Template literals use backticks (`), not single (' ') or double (" ") quotes
2. ${} is used to embed variables inside a string
3. Variable interpolation only works with backticks, not with single or double quotes

### **Step 5**

- At the top of the lab environment, locate the Terminal menu. Click on it to open a dropdown, then select New Terminal.  Use the  `npm start` command to start the development server.  
- If you encounter errors like File not found or Unexpected token, stop the server with `Ctrl+C` in the terminal and restart it using npm start.  
- You can now view the App in your browser by navigating to localhost:3000. To view the output, click on the Browser Preview icon located on the left panel. It is the last icon in the panel.
- In your browser, enter: http://localhost:3000 to see the output. 
- Ensure the button and prompt are visible. If not, check the component code to confirm everything is rendered correctly.   
- Click the button, Enter a number in the prompt dialog,See the generated number and your guess in the alert box. Close the alert and click the button again to play another round.
